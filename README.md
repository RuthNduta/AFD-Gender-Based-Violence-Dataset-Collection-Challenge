# AFD-Gender-Based-Violence-Dataset-Collection-Challenge

The World Health Organization estimates that 35% of women have experienced physical and/or sexual violence at some point in their lives.

As a result of the global pandemic and resulting lock-down measures, gender inequality has increased around the world. This includes concerning rises in cases of violence, sexual assault, and femicide in the past months across Africa and the globe. The United Nations has called this the "shadow pandemic".

Liberia, for example, recorded a 50% increase in gender-based violence (GBV) in the first half of this year. UN's MINUSCA mission in the Central African Republic reported a 27% increase in instances of rape, and a 69% increase in cases where women and children were hurt.

This “shadow pandemic” and GBV in general is often veiled by a culture of silence and a lack of information and data about the problem itself.

We were required to help create, curate and collate quality datasets on GBV. 

## Objective
To help shed light on this topic, to lay the groundwork for informed actions and to support data-driven solutions to contribute to the battle to end GBV.
